  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a 23 year old SE Grad Student with an
  undergraduate degree in EE. I love engineering,
  coding, water polo, and playing my violin in down moods.</p>
  <p>I write this blog to order my flukes, findings, tricks and
  thoughts that would otherwise be lost in an ever increasing number
  of old drives and faulty mental memory.</p>
